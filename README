Just build with
ghc --make RTree.hs

Then run ./RTree <filename>

For the tests,
ghc --make RTreeTest.hs

Then run ./RTreeTest

This runs a few QuickCheck tests, plus one manual (visual inspection) test for the hilbert value function.
The actual tests are near the bottom and are prefixed with t_

******************************

This implementation takes the bounding rect of any set of points (for both the input file and the queries)
This means that a query can be made by simply providing

xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax

(i.e. 2 points), if you want.  Rectangles, of course, work as well.  Either EOF or a blank line will exit.
